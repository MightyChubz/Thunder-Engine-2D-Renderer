# Thunder Engine 2D Renderer
This is a simple renderer made in a day, this supports color setting in runtime and scrolling. I am currently aiming to add more things such as text rendering upon others. Also, yes I will make the ability to render without greyscale available soon, not yet though as i just want to get the system made first.
